## Preliminary Steps

1. [Download Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) and [ensure that it is added to your command line environment](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux). You should see output simiar to the following (the version should start with `1.8`):

   ```txt
   âžœ  java -version

   java version "1.8.0_77"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_77-b03)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.77-b03, mixed mode)
