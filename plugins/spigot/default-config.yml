# The server group is a label that serves as a logical category. Permissions and punishments may be scoped to
# server groups rather than assigned throughout your network, and player traffic stats will be calculated for
# each server group. Generally, each game type your network provides should have a unique server group. Short
# or abbreviated groups look better on the website. Example: KitPvP.

# The server name is a unique identifier for this Minecraft server instance. If a player on your watch list
# appears online, this field will be used to describe the server they are using. The best possible choice
# for this field is the server's public IP, if you know it, but a descriptive label might be good enough.
# Examples: KitPvP 2, KitPvP eu
